## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Provide entry ID for message field: The message field uses a placeholder entry ID (entry.1122334455). Update it with the actual entry ID from Google Form to enable message submission.
- [ ] Update share buttons: Replace YOUR_SITE_URL and YOUR_PAGE_ID with the actual hosted site URL and Facebook Page ID for proper sharing functionality.
- [ ] Test form submission: Open index.html in a browser and test the form submission to ensure data is saved to the Google Sheet 'Dons de vêtements'. Note: Google Forms may require CORS setup or hosting the site on a server for full functionality.
- [ ] Host the website: Upload the files to a web server (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify) to make it accessible online and update share URLs accordingly.
- [ ] Add real photos: Replace placeholder images with actual photos of the orphanage children for a more personal touch (if photos are added back later).
